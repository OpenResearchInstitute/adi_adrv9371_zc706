# COBS Decoder Entity Design Docs

[COBS_dec-Entity-Design.md](COBS_dec-Entity-Design.md) is a low-level design document for the COBS decoder, featuring lots of timing diagrams.

## Timing Diagram Tool
The timing diagrams are drawn using [WaveDrom](https://wavedrom.com), a tool that converts a simple textual description into timing diagrams. The source files are JSON.

***Important: if you use the standalone interactive version of WaveDromEditor, at least the mac OS version, understand that its document handling is very non-standard. There does not seem to be a save command. If you try to open an existing file in WaveDromEditor, it will instead open the last file you had open. This can lead to loss of data if you expect the program to behave normally.***

All the commands in the standalone interactive version of WaveDromEditor are hiding in a hamburger-style menu in the lower right corner.

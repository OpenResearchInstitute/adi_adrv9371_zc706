# Commercial licenses (with commercial support) of this JESD204 core are also

# chips from Analog Devices, incorporate them into your PCB level product, and
# purchase a JESD204 license, end users of your product will also have a
# license to use this core in a commercial setting without releasing their
# source code).
#
# In addition, we kindly ask you to acknowledge ADI in any program, application

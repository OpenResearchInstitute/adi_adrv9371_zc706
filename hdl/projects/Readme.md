# Analog Devices HDL Projects

If you are reading this, you are likely looking for instructions on how to build
one or more of the numerous projects that are maintained on
https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl and supported at http://ez.analog.com/fpga.

Top level instructions for building projects can be found at
https://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/docs/hdl

Each project should have it's own `Readme.md` file which includes on-line pointers:
  * link to the board on https://www.analog.com/ that is being used
  * link(s) to product pages for parts on the board that interface with this HDL, so you can easily find datasheets
  * link to wiki doc for the board using this HDL
  * link to wiki doc for drivers (Linux or No-OS) for the HDL core (if there are any registers in the core)
  * link to wiki doc for drivers (Linux or No-OS) for the parts found on the board

As always, if you have questions - please ask on ADI's support community http://ez.analog.com/fpga
